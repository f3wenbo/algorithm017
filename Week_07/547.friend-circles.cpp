 * Testcase Example:  '[[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]'
 *
 * There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are
 * not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct
 * friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of
 * C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or
 * indirect friends.
 * 
 * Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students
 * in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct
 * friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total
 * number of friend circles among all the students.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 
 * [[1,1,0],
 * ⁠[1,1,0],
 * ⁠[0,0,1]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a
 * friend circle. 
 * The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 
 * [[1,1,0],
 * ⁠[1,1,1],
 * ⁠[0,1,1]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, the 1st and 2nd
 * students are direct friends, 
 * so the 0th and 2nd students are indirect friends. All of them are in the
 * same friend circle, so return 1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= N <= 200
 * M[i][i] == 1
 * M[i][j] == M[j][i]
 *
